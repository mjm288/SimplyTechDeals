# SimplyTechDeals
HackTheMidlands 2020 project. The aim of the project is to collect tech deals from online shopping sites.
I wrote a Python script to web scrape over 470 tech deals from the OverclockersUK website.
# What I Learnt
* Using the BeautifulSoup4 library to web scrape multiple items from a website.
* In doing so, I had to revise my knowledge on the HTML structure of the website, to find information on the items.
* I looped through the item containers, collecting data such as the product name, image, price, link and image.
* I learnt how to write the data on a CSV file, with each line forming a distinct product.
* I used the urllib.request library to loop through multiple pages and collect even more items.
# Future Plans
* I'm planning to display the data on a website, with each Bootstrap card representing an item.
* I'm also considering adding a feature to search and sort for items.
